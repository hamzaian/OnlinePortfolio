          <h2><strong>Objective:</strong></h2> To create a fun and challenging game using the Scratch platform. We needed to create a game that utilizes multiple sprites and backdrops. We were also required to document our game and explain the instructions
          and features of our design.
          <br>
          <h2> Description:</h2>
          <p>My partner and I decided to create a game where we would include our favorite sport, basketball. We came across an existing game on Scratch, which we decided to modify by incorparating multiple backdrops, more sprites and different difficulty levels as well as randomized basket movement to add a previously non existent dynamism to the game.
            I took on the role of creating obstacles and difficulty systems for the game as well as the score system, I alternated with my partner as to the task of documenting important decisions we made and the features that were added. During the development of our game, we faced obstacles 
            such as laggy level transitions and wrong sprites being assigned to levels, problems resetting the game and scoreboard, and trial and error in order to find a movement mechanism that was random and unpredictable. We were able to overcome these difficulties by discussing different solutions and remaining calm and collected. In the end, I learned efficent ways to put patterns and algorithims togethe in order to create more complex functioning code and also learned how to think critically and creatively to come up with solutions to problems as well as how to manage my time properly to get the job done within the agreed upon timeframe.
